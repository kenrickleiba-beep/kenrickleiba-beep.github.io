Home and classroom maths practice tool

1. OVERVIEW

The Ultimate Maths Quiz is a flexible maths practice program designed for children.
It supports:

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

Fixed-number practice (for targeted drilling)

Times tables practice

Adaptive difficulty

Visual customisation for accessibility and engagement

Automatic saving of results to a CSV file

It is suitable for home use, tutoring, and classroom practice.

2. FIRST TIME SETUP & SAVING RESULTS

Important: CSV file usage

On the first run, you will be asked where to save a results file (CSV).

This location is remembered automatically for future runs.

Results are appended to the same file each time.

Recommendation:
Have the CSV file closed while the program is running.
Some spreadsheet programs (e.g. Excel) can lock the file, which may prevent saving.

Each quiz attempt saves:

Student name

Date and time

Total time taken

Score

Quiz length

Operations selected

Fixed mode status

Adaptive mode status

3. QUIZ MODES EXPLAINED
A. Operations

You can choose any combination of:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Questions are randomly mixed from the selected operations.

B. Maximum Numbers

You can set maximum values for:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

This controls the difficulty range of generated questions.

C. Fixed Modes (Targeted Practice)

Fixed modes are useful when a child needs repetition with a specific number.

Fixed Addition
Example: Always add 5 (e.g. 5 + 3, 5 + 12)

Fixed Subtraction
Example: Always subtract 5 (e.g. 18 − 5)

Fixed Division
Example: Always divide by 2 (e.g. 14 ÷ 2)

Only enable fixed modes intentionally. They override random generation for that operation.

D. Times Tables

You may select specific times tables (0–12).

If tables are selected, multiplication questions will use them.

If none are selected, multiplication is fully random.

This allows focused practice (e.g. only ×7 and ×8).

E. Quiz Length

Controls how many questions appear in the quiz.
Useful for:

Short warm-ups

Longer practice sessions

Preventing fatigue

F. No Repeat Questions

When enabled:

The program avoids repeating identical questions.

If the number of possible unique questions runs out, the quiz ends safely.

This is ideal for mastery practice, but should be used carefully with very small ranges.

G. Adaptive Difficulty

When enabled:

Faster, correct answers slightly increase difficulty

Slow or incorrect answers slightly reduce difficulty

This helps keep the quiz in the learner’s “just right” challenge zone.

4. APPEARANCE SETTINGS

The Appearance menu allows you to adjust:

Background colour

Font colour

Font family

Font size

This is especially useful for:

Young learners

Visual accessibility

Dyslexia-friendly layouts

Personal preference

Changes apply immediately.

5. QUIZ FEEDBACK & REVIEW

At the end of the quiz, the program shows:

Score

Total time taken

Encouraging feedback based on speed and accuracy

A full review of questions:

Correct answers shown in green

Incorrect answers shown in red

This supports reflection and discussion.

6. PEDAGOGICAL TIPS (HOW TO USE IT WELL)

Short, frequent quizzes are better than long ones.

Use fixed modes for targeted remediation.

Use adaptive mode once basic confidence is established.

Turn off “No repeat questions” when working with very small number ranges.

Encourage children to explain how they got an answer, not just give it.

Use colour and font changes to help students feel ownership of the activity.

Focus feedback on effort and improvement, not just score.

7. COMMON ISSUES

Results not saving:
Make sure the CSV file is not open in another program.

Quiz ends early with No Repeat on:
This means all possible unique questions were used.

This is expected behaviour, not a crash.

8. FINAL NOTE

This program is designed to support confidence, fluency, and enjoyment in maths.
It is flexible by design—adjust settings often to suit the learner.
